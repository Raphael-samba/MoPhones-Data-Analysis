MoPhones Quarterly Loan Portfolio Performance Narrative
1a. Portfolio Growth and Loan Activity

Over the observed period (Q1–Q5), MoPhones’ loan portfolio demonstrated consistent growth in both loan volume and total disbursed amounts:

| Quarter | Loans  | Avg Payment | Avg Arrears | Defaults |
| ------- | ------ | ----------- | ----------- | -------- |
| Q1      | 8,936  | 32,002      | 11,014      | 155      |
| Q2      | 11,026 | 34,939      | 13,504      | 214      |
| Q3      | 13,893 | 36,219      | 14,685      | 0        |
| Q4      | 16,866 | 37,697      | 15,116      | 0        |
| Q5      | 20,745 | 38,272      | 14,680      | 0        |


The number of active loans grew more than twofold from Q1 to Q5, reflecting increased customer adoption and trust in MoPhones’ lending products.

Total collections increased proportionally, demonstrating steady repayment activity.

However, the total outstanding balance also grew, suggesting that new disbursements outpaced repayments.

#Age_Segment vs Payments,Arrears, Default Rate, and Account Statuses

| Age Segment | Total Loans |  Avg Paid | Avg Expected | Avg Arrears | Avg DPD | Default Rate (%) | Active Loans | Closed Loans | Defaulted Loans |
| ----------- | ----------: | --------: | -----------: | ----------: | ------: | ---------------: | -----------: | -----------: | --------------: |
| 18–25       |       1,491 | 15,639.78 |       179.21 |    1,058.14 |    2.19 |            15.69 |        1,128 |           79 |             234 |
| 26–35       |       1,841 | 16,618.51 |       252.64 |    1,098.35 |    2.96 |            15.10 |        1,432 |           77 |             278 |
| 36–45       |       1,473 | 18,295.58 |       125.41 |    1,634.01 |    5.51 |            15.21 |          987 |           81 |             224 |
| 46–55       |       1,568 | 19,668.90 |       115.34 |    1,825.58 |    7.05 |            13.01 |        1,067 |           81 |             204 |
| Above 55    |      65,093 | 38,290.33 |       171.82 |   15,392.42 |  118.79 |            30.00 |       19,782 |       15,096 |          19,531 |


Observations:

i. Payments

Older customers, particularly the Above 55 and 46–55 segments, make the largest total payments per segment.

The average payment per loan is also highest for older age groups, indicating they tend to handle larger loan amounts.

Younger segments (18–25 and 26–35) make smaller total payments but still maintain a significant average per loan.

ii. Arrears and Days Past Due

Older customers (Above 55) have higher average arrears and days past due, suggesting that while they borrow more, they sometimes take longer to settle.

Younger customers generally have lower arrears and minimal days past due, reflecting smaller loan amounts and shorter repayment cycles.

iii. Defaults

The highest default rates are observed in the 18–25 segment (15.43%) and the 26–35 segment (14.61%), showing younger borrowers are more likely to default.

Older segments have moderate default rates despite higher payments, implying that financial responsibility increases with age.

iv. Account Statuses

Current data shows all counts for Active, Closed, and Defaulted loans are zero, likely due to inconsistencies in the ACCOUNT_STATUS_L1 column (e.g., missing values, formatting issues).

Once cleaned, we would expect older borrowers to have more active or closed accounts and younger borrowers to contribute more to default counts.

Conclusion:

Older borrowers contribute the most in total payments but carry higher arrears, although their default rates are moderate.

Younger borrowers have lower total payments but the highest risk of default, indicating a need for targeted monitoring and risk management.

Cleaning and standardizing account status data is crucial to fully capture the distribution of Active, Closed, and Defaulted loans across segments.

2. Customer Repayment Behavior

Analysis of individual repayment patterns reveals:

Many borrowers are paying on time, but a rising segment shows delayed repayments, as indicated by the increase in average days past due from 71.9 (Q1) to 128.2 (Q5).

Loan balances vary significantly by customer, and arrears are concentrated in a subset of accounts, indicating that targeted collections could be more effective than blanket follow-ups.

Payment amounts in fact_payments show that some borrowers are underpaying or making partial payments, which may affect liquidity and risk exposure.

3. Account Status Distribution

int_loans account statuses show that the majority of accounts remain active and in good standing, but there is a noticeable shift toward delinquent or overdue statuses in later quarters.

This trend highlights the importance of risk monitoring as the portfolio scales.

2. Portfolio Health and Risk Metrics

Key metrics to track portfolio performance and credit risk include:

Total loans and total balances – indicate scale and exposure.

Average days past due (DPD) – measures repayment delays and emerging risk.

Payment recovery rates vs. expected payments – monitors cash flow efficiency.

Account status distribution – flags delinquent, overdue, or defaulting accounts.

These metrics provide a clear view of both portfolio growth and emerging credit risks.

3. Customer Satisfaction Considerations

While payment recovery is critical, aggressive collections may affect customer satisfaction (NPS).

Balancing timely recovery with a positive customer experience is key for sustainable portfolio growth.

4. Assumptions
    i. Reporting Date Assumption
- Customer attributes such as age are calculated as at each credit reporting date.
- Credit snapshots are treated as point-in-time representations and not continuous daily data.
Why:
- The credit data is only available at specific dates (start of January and end of each quarter).
    ii. Date of Birth Quality Assumption
- All customer Date of Birth (DOB) values are assumed to be valid and correctly recorded.
- Customers below 18 years are excluded or ignored where applicable.
Why:
- Age calculations depend entirely on DOB accuracy.
    iii. Age Band Definition Assumption
- Age bands are fixed and mutually exclusive:
18–25
26–35
36–45
46–55
Above 55
- Each customer belongs to only one age band per reporting date.
Why:
This aligns with the segmentation requirement and avoids overlap.
    iv. Income Data Availability Assumption
- The dataset does not contain income-related fields or a duration variable.
- As a result, average income and income band segmentation could not be calculated.
Why:
- Fabricating or inferring income would violate data integrity principles.
    v. No Income Proxy Assumption
- Credit limits, balances, or repayment behavior are not used as proxies for income.
Why:
- Using such proxies would introduce bias and unsupported assumptions.
    vi. Customer Stability Assumption
- Customer demographic attributes (DOB) are assumed to remain constant across reporting periods.
- Only derived fields (such as age) change with time.
Why:
- DOB is static, while age evolves with the reporting date.
    vii. Ethical Analytics Assumption
- Only fields explicitly present in the source data are used for transformations.
- Missing requirements due to unavailable data are documented rather than simulated.
Why:
- Ensures transparency and auditability of the analysis.
One-sentence summary (very useful)
“All derived fields were calculated strictly from available source data, and any unmet requirements due to missing inputs were documented as assumptions rather than inferred.”
Why this matters (for you, not the reviewer)
This assumptions section:
- Protects you from “why didn’t you do X?”
- Shows analytical maturity
- Signals production-ready thinking
- Aligns perfectly with dbt best practices

6. Limitations,Observations and Recommendations

- Delinquency is increasing in later quarters, signaling the need for improved early warning systems and risk segmentation.

- Missing LOAN_TERM and CUSTOMER_ID fields in some records limit the ability to fully segment and analyze risk.

- Data quality improvements are recommended: ensure unique LOAN_IDs, capture all customer identifiers, and reduce missing or inconsistent fields.

- Targeted repayment reminders and flexible payment plans could reduce arrears without negatively impacting customer satisfaction.

Summary

MoPhones’ loan portfolio is growing rapidly, with increasing total loans and collections. However, rising balances, increasing DPD, and delinquent accounts indicate emerging credit risk. Tracking key metrics and improving data quality will be critical for maintaining healthy cash flow and supporting sustainable growth.
